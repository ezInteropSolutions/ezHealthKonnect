// The tier-1 block decoder, PS 15444-1 Annex D.
//
// A code-block's bytes are one MQ-coded stream, and this is what reads it. The
// coefficients are decoded a bit plane at a time, most significant first, and
// each plane in three passes: significance propagation, magnitude refinement,
// and cleanup. Which pass a coefficient's bit belongs to depends on what its
// neighbors have done so far, so the passes are not independent — they walk
// the same block in the same order, and the order is what keeps encoder and
// decoder in step.
//
// The contexts are the point of the whole design: a bit is coded against a
// probability learned from the eight neighbors, so a smooth image spends
// almost nothing on the long runs of zeros that make up most of a subband.
//
// Only code-block style 0x00 is decoded. Bypass, termall, vertical causal,
// predictable termination and segmentation marks are refused by the parser, so
// nothing here has to guess at a variant it has never seen.

// run of a cleanup pass, five for sign, three for refinement, and one uniform.

// context of a sample is then a table lookup on those eight bits, instead of
